# A Happy Dot

A Happy Dot is a single player game about getting a lost emoji back home. The player will be controlling Happy, the emoji, with their mouse. The objective of the game is to avoid colliding Happy into any incoming obstacles. The game takes place over 3 rounds. If the player manages to avoid colliding Happy into any obstacles during that time, they win the game.

## Approach Taken

My approach to the game was to start with the end in mind. I wanted an animated and interactive game for my players. Originally, the game was supposed to have randomly generated objects that would fly across the screen for the player to dodge. This was supposed to happen infinitely until the player collided with an object. Due to the outline given by the instructor, the game idea had to be revised since the game must have multiple rounds of play and a win state. In the end, I decided to keep the original spirit of the game(minus some of the randomness), added a mini story to it, and animated the obstacles in a more realistic way. In order to animate the player and images across the page, I had to use the Canvas API. Since there are multiple rounds of image generation in the game, I made that function customizable and reusable. The rounds and win state are generated by setTimeOut.
